            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Consider the cost factor while picking a destination. Some places are more enjoyable in a luxury budget than others.

            <ul>
                <li>Ease of accessibility or lack thereof is also a factor that can sway the decision of visiting a destination or not. Generally, the popular destinations have a lot of daily flights, trains, and good highway infrastructure to support the tourist influx.

            <ul>
                <li>A key aspect of a good trip planner is to correctly estimate the number of days required to visit a destination. A road trip planner would elongate the duration of a trip whereas, a trip planned with flight tickets could be a little shorter.
                </li>
                <li>Trips, where the destination is within 8 hours, can also be done on a weekend provided that the night time is utilized for traveling.
                </li>
                <li>A trip with a lot of urban destinations will need more time in the sightseeing, and therefore a longer trip duration. Whereas a trip to a tropical beach town would not involve much sightseeing and hence, the duration can be shorter.
                </li>
                <li>It is advisable to keep a vacant day in touring plans that exceed 7 days. This gives a buffer to things like flight/train delays, traffic jams, weather hold-ups, or a change-of-heart to extend one’s stay at a particular destination.
